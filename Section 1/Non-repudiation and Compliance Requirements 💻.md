First of all, What is repudiation ?

**Repudiation** is simply "you didn't do something" or it is the act of denying responsibility or accountability for an action or event. In the context of cybersecurity, repudiation refers to the act of denying that a user performed a cybersecurity attack or violated a security policy.

Let's say a user sends a malicious email and then tries to deny that they sent it. That would be a type of repudiation.  

Another example would be if a company's data is stolen, and the company denies that they were responsible for protecting it.

> Repudiation can be a serious issue in online transactions, such as e-commerce, where one party may deny having placed an order or authorized a payment, making it difficult to hold them accountable. It can also be a problem in systems where multiple users have access to shared resources, as one user may deny having deleted or modified a file

So, Non-repudiation is much like the property of authentication in that their implementations often share much of the same primitives. For example, a public key signature can be a nonrepudiation device if only one specific party has the ability to produce signatures.

**Non-repudiation** is all about making sure that no one can deny that they did something. This is especially important in the world of cyber security. For example, if someone hacks into your system and steals your data, you want to be able to prove that it wasn't you who did it! ðŸ«£

**Compliance Requirements** are like rules that organizations have to follow to keep their data safe. For example, if a company wants to do business in a certain country, they have to follow the laws in that country. If they don't follow these rules, they might get in trouble. ðŸ˜£
